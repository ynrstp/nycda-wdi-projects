# User-information application

Simple web app to search for user information stored in a JSON file, using a Node.js server with Express. Used Jade to pass data to my HTML and speed up the process. Ajax is used to get working autocomplete functionality when searching(throttled at max 1 request per 2 seconds).

Modules used: Express.js,Jade, and Body-parser to get form values
